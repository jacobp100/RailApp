UK rail timetable app with offline support

React Native app. Was written well for the time, but now needs modernising

Offline timetables generated as protobuf, then LZMA compressed. This would take the data from 300mb to ~7mb. See https://github.com/jacobp100/rail-timetables-protobuf

I no longer maintain this app. If you would like to take ownership of this, please message me
